# RULES
You may use only the datasets provided for this competition. Your solution must use machine learning.

This is a computer vision challenge. No metadata may be used.

If your solution places 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in the final ranking, you will be required to submit your winning solution code to us for verification and you thereby agree to share all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.

If your solution places 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in the final ranking on the private leaderboard, you will be required to submit your winning solution code to us for verification.

You will have until 18:29 GMT on 21 March 2020 to submit your code for review. Submit your code to zindi@zindi.africa with subject line “Challenge name position # - team name or username and university.” Regardless of any public announcement of winners, Zindi reserves the right to disqualify any user, team, or university on or even after 21 March 2020 if the code does not reproduce the winning submission.

Individual competitors are able to form teams on this competition. You must accept the rules associated with teaming up.

Multiple accounts per user are not allowed. Collaboration across individuals not in the same team is not allowed. And collaboration across different teams that is not allowed.

Code must not be shared privately. Any code that is shared, must be made available to all competition participants through the platform.

The solution must use publicly-available, open-source packages only.

Maximum 200 solutions submitted per day. Your highest-scoring solution will be the one by which you are judged.

Note that there are Public and Private Leaderboards. The Public Leaderboard excludes approximately 50% of the test dataset. While the competition is open, the Public Leaderboard will rank the submitted solutions by the accuracy score they achieve. Upon close of the competition, the Private Leaderboard, which covers 100% of the test dataset, will be made public and will constitute the final ranking for the competition.

If two solutions earn identical scores on the leaderboard, the tie breaker will be the date and time in which the submission was made (the earlier solution will win).

Refer to the FAQs and Terms of Use for additional rules that may apply to this competition.

You acknowledge and agree that Zindi may, without any obligation to do so, remove or disqualify an individual, team, account, or university if Zindi believes that such individual, team, account, or university is in violation of these Rules.
